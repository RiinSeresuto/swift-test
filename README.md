# Swift Test - A Test Paper Generator

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Step 0: Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

-   Node.js: If you don't have node.js installed, you can download and install it from the official website: https://nodejs.org
-   npm or pnpm: npm (Node Package Manager) is usually installed automatically with node.js. If you prefer using pnpm, you can install it globally by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

-   Terminal: You will need a terminal to run commands.

### Step 1: Installing Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

or if you are using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Step 2: Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

or if you are using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Step 3: Access the Application

Once the server is running, open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application.
